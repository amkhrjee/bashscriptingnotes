# Welcome to my notes! 
This is my personal repo of notes I make while learning bash scripting. 
While documenting interesting topics related to scripting for bash, it inadvertently ytouches on nuggets of topics of the UNIX as a whole. 

Currently my main resource of learning, among numerous other articles on the internet, is the [Linux Documentiing Project](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/). 

While I am making this for my personal reference, I hope you will be able to extract something of value from this. 

Thanks for visiting!
