# Linux File Modes
For viewing the file mode of an file, we do ls -l filename.extension 

The first three letters -> access for the user
Next three letters -> access for the group 
Next three letters -> access for 'others'

For example, `-rwxr-x---` means the user has read(`r`), write(`w`) & execute(`x`) access.
The group has read and execute access and others have no access.
