# Magic Numbers (Format Indicators)
A magic number is a sequence of bytes that is used in all files of a certain format, usually at a given position (often at the beginning). Since all files in that particular format have that particular byte sequence in that particular position, and most files in other formats don't have it, the magic number is a way to recognize what format a file is in.
